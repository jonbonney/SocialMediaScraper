TikTok account collection notes:

- Boss Holdings Inc. has bossgloves.com listed as the URL which matches up with the bossgloves twitter handle, but the Instagram account “boss” that is listed for them appears to be a different company called “Hugo Boss” which also has the tiktok account “boss”
- CityCenter Holdings LLC has aria listed as their accounts which appears to be a different company
- Discoveryinc exists as a tiktok but it a different company (perhaps a fake company)
- There is a verified tiktok account called engie, but it is for a drink company, not the energy company Engie SA that is in our dataset.
- @nz is an account that appears to represent the country of New Zealand, which isn’t a company, but perhaps notable since it is listed as an account in the dataset.
- First Internet Bancorp (in our dataset) seems to have a sibling company called first internet bank, which has a tiktok account called firstib. I haven’t been able to confirm yet that they are the same company.
- Gillette’s Indian accounts are in the dataset, but not their US accounts. The “Gillette” account I’ve added appears to be for the US market.
- Tiktok account “graniteconstruction” appears to be a different company than the one in our dataset
- Ourbrew was listed as the YouTube channel for Molson Coors Canada Inc. Since They do not seem to be related except for both being beer companies, I have removed ourbrew from the row. I will add it back if they are later shown to be connected. There is a matching tiktok account “ourbrew” as well.
